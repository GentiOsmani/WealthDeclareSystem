Wealth Declare System
FOR TEST PURPOSES ONLY

Admin Initials: ID : 0000000001 Password : ImE!1234

If you want to use the application, you'll first need to have SSMS installed on your device. Once that’s done, open the Package Manager Console and type **Add-Migration** and **Update-Database** to create the necessary database tables for the application to work correctly. Great! We're done!

Now you can **Add Users**. Users will only have access to the application if you grant them access. Here's how to do that:

  1. Run the application.
  2. Log in as Admin (ID: 0000000001, Password: ImE!1234).
  3.  Navigate to Add Users.
  4. Fill in all of the required input fields. (The user will be able to log in with the identity number you’re registering the user with. The email should be a legitimate email because the user will receive their password there).
  5. Done! The user will receive an email with the information and the manual they need to declare their wealth.
